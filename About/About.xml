This mod is meant for XML modders.

There is an outfit in RimWorld called Anything. It is the default outfit assigned to all pawns. At game start, all apparel in the defs is added to the Anything outfit.

RFAO will prevent the Anything outfit from initially allowing apparel with RemoveFromAnything in the defaultOutfitTags list. This is mostly useful for mods with apparel that might be dangerous to wear.

RFAO only affects the initial Anything outfit generated at game start. The player can still modify the Anything outfit to allow apparel with RemoveFromAnything in the defaultOutfitTags list.

Requires HugsLib for Harmony.

Compatibility note: RFAO applies a Postfix patch to RimWorld.OutfitDatabase.GenerateStartingOutfits(). In other words, it should be safe to mix with other mods without issue.

Mod Order: Anywhere below HugsLib.
